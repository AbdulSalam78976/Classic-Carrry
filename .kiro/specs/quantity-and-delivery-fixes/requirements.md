# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues with quantity updates on the product detail page and checkout page, and implements a fixed delivery charge system. The current implementation has inconsistent quantity update behavior that sometimes works and sometimes fails, creating a poor user experience. Additionally, the checkout system needs to include a fixed delivery charge of 300 Rs to provide transparent pricing to customers.
